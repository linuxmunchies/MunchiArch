# MunchiArch
A custom-built Arch Linux install tailored specifically for my needs, but made to be a bit more cross-compatible with different hardware.
I've been working on this for months, but this is the first public version of it. It is a multi-generational leap in complexity over my previous public script releases. 
I very much encourage you to test these sparingly, as they have only been tested on a small subset of hardware. But, they yield a system more stable than Windows! =)
